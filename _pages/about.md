Welcome to my homepage!  
I am a third-year undergraduate student majoring in Astronomy at the [School of Physics and Materials Science](https://spee.gzhu.edu.cn/index.htm), [Guangzhou University](https://www.gzhu.edu.cn/). My research interests focus on galaxy formation and evolution and numerical simulations of the large-scale structure of the universe.
