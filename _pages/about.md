I am a junior majoring in Astronomy, in the [Deparment of Physics & Materials](https://spee.gzhu.edu.cn/index.htm) 
at [Guangzhou University](https://www.gzhu.edu.cn/), China.

My main research interests include galaxy formation and evolution, dark matter, cosmology, and related topics. I have also been involved in relevant research projects.
