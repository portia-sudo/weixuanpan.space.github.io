I'm a third year undergraduate student from [School of Physics and Materials Science](https://spee.gzhu.edu.cn/index.htm), [Guangzhou University](https://www.gzhu.edu.cn/). My main research interests include galaxy formation and evolution, dark matter, cosmology, and related topics. I have also been involved in relevant research projects.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Dr. Yewei Mao](https://spee.gzhu.edu.cn/info/1681/18121.htm) from [School of Physics and Materials Science](https://spee.gzhu.edu.cn/index.htm), Guangzhou University. I was advised by [Dr. Qiao Wang](https://nao.cas.cn/jypy/ds/ssds/202204/t20220406_6419582.html) from [National Astronomical Observatories](https://english.nao.cas.cn/), Chinese Academy of Sciences.
